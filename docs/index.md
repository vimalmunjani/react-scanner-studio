## Why React Scanner Studio?

Understanding how components are used across a large codebase can be challenging. React Scanner Studio bridges the gap between raw scan data and actionable insights by providing:

- **Visual component usage statistics** — See which components are most used at a glance
- **Prop analysis** — Understand which props are commonly used and which are rarely touched
- **Shareable reports** — Build static dashboards that can be hosted on any static file server
- **Design system metrics** — Track adoption of your design system components over time

## Quick Example

```bash
# Initialize configuration
npx react-scanner-studio init

# Scan your codebase for component usage
npx react-scanner-studio scan

# Start the interactive dashboard
npx react-scanner-studio start
```

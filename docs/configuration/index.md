# Configuration

React Scanner Studio uses the `react-scanner.config.js` configuration file to determine how to scan your codebase and where to output the results.

## Overview

When you run `react-scanner-studio init`, a configuration file is automatically created in your current directory. This file is used by both `react-scanner` (to scan your codebase) and React Scanner Studio (to locate the scan output).

## Default Configuration

Here's the default configuration generated by `react-scanner-studio init`:

```js
module.exports = {
  crawlFrom: './src',
  includeSubComponents: true,
  importedFrom: '@mui/material',
  processors: [
    ['raw-report', { outputTo: './.react-scanner-studio/scan-report.json' }],
  ],
};
```

## Configuration File Location

The configuration file must be named `react-scanner.config.js`. React Scanner Studio searches for this file starting from the current directory and moving upward through parent directories until it finds it. This allows you to run commands from any subdirectory within your project.

```
your-project/
├── react-scanner.config.js  ← Configuration file
├── package.json
├── src/
│   └── ...
└── .react-scanner-studio/   ← Output directory
    └── scan-report.json
```

## How It Works

1. **react-scanner** reads `react-scanner.config.js` to know:
   - Where to look for components (`crawlFrom`)
   - Which components to track (`importedFrom`)
   - Where to output the results (`processors[].outputTo`)

2. **React Scanner Studio** reads the same config to find the scan output file and display it in the dashboard.

## Example Configurations

### Material UI

```js
module.exports = {
  crawlFrom: './src',
  includeSubComponents: true,
  importedFrom: '@mui/material',
  processors: [
    ['raw-report', { outputTo: './.react-scanner-studio/scan-report.json' }],
  ],
};
```

### Chakra UI

```js
module.exports = {
  crawlFrom: './src',
  includeSubComponents: true,
  importedFrom: '@chakra-ui/react',
  processors: [
    ['raw-report', { outputTo: './.react-scanner-studio/scan-report.json' }],
  ],
};
```

### Ant Design

```js
module.exports = {
  crawlFrom: './src',
  includeSubComponents: true,
  importedFrom: 'antd',
  processors: [
    ['raw-report', { outputTo: './.react-scanner-studio/scan-report.json' }],
  ],
};
```

### Custom Component Library

```js
module.exports = {
  crawlFrom: './src',
  includeSubComponents: true,
  importedFrom: '@myorg/design-system',
  processors: [
    ['raw-report', { outputTo: './.react-scanner-studio/scan-report.json' }],
  ],
};
```

### Local Components

```js
module.exports = {
  crawlFrom: './src',
  includeSubComponents: true,
  importedFrom: /\.\/components/, // Regex pattern
  processors: [
    ['raw-report', { outputTo: './.react-scanner-studio/scan-report.json' }],
  ],
};
```

### Next.js App Directory

```js
module.exports = {
  crawlFrom: './app',
  includeSubComponents: true,
  importedFrom: '@/components',
  processors: [
    ['raw-report', { outputTo: './.react-scanner-studio/scan-report.json' }],
  ],
};
```

### Monorepo Setup

```js
module.exports = {
  crawlFrom: './packages',
  includeSubComponents: true,
  importedFrom: '@myorg/ui',
  processors: [
    ['raw-report', { outputTo: './.react-scanner-studio/scan-report.json' }],
  ],
};
```

## Important Notes

::: warning Output Path
React Scanner Studio expects the output file to be in `.react-scanner-studio/scan-report.json`. If you change this path, make sure to update it consistently.
:::

::: tip Multiple Import Sources
You can use a regex pattern for `importedFrom` to track components from multiple sources:

```js
importedFrom: /@mui\/material|@mui\/icons-material/;
```
